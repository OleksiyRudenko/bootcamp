1. In your course repo `README.md`:
   - Add `## Git Collaboration` module title.
   - Describe 2 or 3 things that
     * were new to you
     * were familiar but you have seen them at a different angle
     * were not so easy to master or comprehend     

Any of your writings above can be done in a language you
feel most comfortable with.

If you find some topic not sufficiently disclosed in any
materials, just, let us know.

## When completed

When done let others know you have passed this module.

This lets other know your progress and probably someone
will ask you for some help in this module.

Where to communicate? In a chat you come here from :)

Now you are ready to proceed to
